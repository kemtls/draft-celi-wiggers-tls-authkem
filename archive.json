However,\r\n  there are subtle details:\r\n\r\n  * The certificate being a message, it is subject to acknowledgements.\r\n    However, server hello must be logically before it. This is required\r\n    to meet the acknowledgment epoch rule.\r\n  * The server flight needs to be broken into two just before server\r\n    Finished, first part being unordered with certificate, and second\r\n    being the next flight.
